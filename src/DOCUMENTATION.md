# Building Exitbetter: A Step-by-Step Guide

This document provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to building the Exitbetter application from scratch. It assumes a working knowledge of Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Recent Updates (Since July 14, 2025)

We've been hard at work adding new features to make the ExitBetter platform more powerful for HR Managers and more supportive for end-users. Hereâ€™s a look at what's new:

### For HR Managers: New Tools for Tailored Support

*   **Bulk User Upload:** You can now add multiple employees at once using the powerful new **CSV Upload** feature on the User Management page. The template allows you to pre-fill key dates and user-specific contact information, dramatically streamlining the onboarding process.
*   **Resource Center Management:** You can now upload and manage company-specific documents directly through the new **Resources** page in your admin dashboard. Share important files like benefits guides, company policies, and contact lists to provide tailored support for your exiting employees.
*   **Company Settings Hub:** A dedicated **Company Settings** page has been added. Here, you can view your company's subscription plan, track user license usage, and set default contact aliases and deadline timezones for your employees.
*   **HR Team Management:** As a Primary HR Manager, you can now manage your own HR team by adding other managers and assigning them specific, granular permissions for each module on a per-company basis.
*   **New HR Manager Guide:** To help you get the most out of these new features, a comprehensive **Help & Guide** page is now available directly from your admin sidebar.

### For Admins: Powerful New Content & Rule Management

*   **Content Management Section:** The Admin sidebar has been reorganized. "Task Management" and a new **"Tips Management"** page are now grouped under a "Content Management" section for a more intuitive workflow.
*   **"Did You Know..." Tips:** Admins can now create and manage a master list of contextual tips. These tips can be mapped to specific question answers, providing users with helpful information alongside their actionable tasks.
*   **Bulk CSV Management:** Both the Task and Tips management pages now support bulk operations. Admins can download a CSV template, add or edit multiple items in a spreadsheet, and upload the file to apply changes in bulk.
*   **Advanced Guidance Rules:** The **Guidance & Review** page now includes a fully functional "Guidance Rules" tab. This powerful feature allows Admins to create deterministic rules with multiple, complex conditions (e.g., based on tenure, date ranges) to assign specific tasks, overriding the default AI recommendations when necessary.
*   **Inline Content Creation:** The workflow for mapping content has been streamlined. From the "Map Tasks" dialog in the form editor, Admins can now create a new task or tip on the fly without navigating to a different page.

### For End-Users: An Improved & More Empathetic Experience

*   **Enhanced Language:** We've updated the platform's language to be more inclusive and empathetic. Terms like "Pre/Post-Layoff" have been changed to **Pre/Post-End Date** to better reflect all types of employment separations.
*   **Visual Key Dates Timeline:** Your dashboard now features an interactive timeline that visually maps out all your critical deadlines, from your final day to insurance coverage end dates, helping you see what's coming at a glance.
*   **Start Over Functionality:** You now have the ability to clear your profile and assessment data and start fresh via an option in the user menu.

### General Platform Enhancements

*   **Sortable User Lists:** The user management table for HR Managers now includes sortable columns, making it easier to organize and find employee records.
*   **Prototype Status Banner:** A clear banner has been added to all pages to remind users that the application is a prototype and data may be reset.

## 1. Initial Project Setup

The foundation of the application is a standard Next.js project.

### 1.1. Initialize Next.js App

Start by creating a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest exitbetter --typescript --tailwind --eslint
```

### 1.2. Install Core Dependencies

Navigate into your project directory and install the necessary packages for UI components, state management, forms, and drag-and-drop functionality.

```bash
cd exitbetter
npm install \
  @radix-ui/react-accordion @radix-ui/react-alert-dialog @radix-ui/react-avatar \
  @radix-ui/react-checkbox @radix-ui/react-collapsible @radix-ui/react-dialog \
  @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu @radix-ui/react-label @radix-ui/react-menubar \
  @radix-ui/react-popover @radix-ui/react-progress @radix-ui/react-radio-group \
  @radix-ui/react-scroll-area @radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-separator \
  @radix-ui/react-slider @radix-ui/react-slot @radix-ui/react-switch \
  @radix-ui/react-tabs @radix-ui/react-toast @radix-ui/react-tooltip \
  class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge tailwindcss-animate \
  lucide-react react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers zod date-fns react-day-picker \
  @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable papaparse
```

### 1.3. Install AI Dependencies

Install Genkit for handling AI-powered features.

```bash
npm install genkit @genkit-ai/googleai @genkit-ai/next
```

## 2. UI and Styling Configuration

### 2.1. Initialize ShadCN UI

Initialize ShadCN UI to manage your component library. This will create the `components.json` file and set up necessary folders.

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```
Follow the prompts, selecting `Default` style, `Neutral` for the base color, and confirming your paths for `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`.

### 2.2. Configure Fonts and Theme

Update `src/app/layout.tsx` to import and use the 'Inter' and 'Space Grotesk' fonts from Google Fonts for body and headline text, respectively. Then, update `src/app/globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` to reflect the application's color palette (primary, accent, background) using HSL CSS variables as defined in the project files.

## 3. Core Application Logic

### 3.1. Authentication (`useAuth`)

Create a custom React hook `src/hooks/use-auth.tsx` to manage the user's authentication state globally.
- **Technology:** Use `React.Context` to provide auth state to the entire application. Wrap the root layout in an `AuthProvider`.
- **State:** The `auth` object should contain `role`, `email`, `companyId`, `companyName`, and an `isPreview` flag.
- **Persistence:** Store the `auth` object in `localStorage` to keep users logged in across sessions. Also store the original auth state when an HR manager enters "User Preview" mode.
- **Functions:**
  - `login(authData)`: Saves auth state to `localStorage` and React state.
  - `logout()`: Clears all auth and user data from `localStorage`.
  - `startUserView()`: For HR Managers, saves current auth state as "original" and creates a temporary "end-user" auth state for previewing the user experience.
  - `stopUserView()`: Restores the original HR Manager auth state from `localStorage`.

### 3.2. Data Management (`useUserData`)

Create a central data management hook `src/hooks/use-user-data.tsx`. This hook is the single source of truth for all application data, abstracting away the underlying storage mechanism.

- **Shared Data (In-Memory "Database"):**
  - Create a file `src/lib/demo-data.ts` to hold shared information like `companyAssignments`, `platformUsers`, and the `masterQuestions` list.
  - To simulate persistence across hot reloads in development, attach this data store to the `globalThis` object. This ensures custom questions and other changes are not lost on every file save.
- **User-Specific Data (`localStorage`):**
  - Manage user-specific data like `profileData` and `assessmentData` using React state that is hydrated from and saved to `localStorage`.
  - Handle a separate set of keys for the HR "User Preview" mode (e.g., `exitbetter-profile-hr-preview`) to keep the preview data isolated.
- **Core Functions:**
  - **Data Accessors:** Expose functions to get all data types (e.g., `getAllCompanyConfigs()`, `getMasterQuestions()`).
  - **Data Mutators:** Create functions to save changes back to the in-memory store (e.g., `saveCompanyConfig(name, config)`, `saveMasterQuestions(questions)`). This pattern makes it easy to swap the in-memory store for a real database later.
  - **Derived Data:** Implement logic like `getCompanyConfig(companyName)` which intelligently merges the `masterQuestions` with company-specific `overrides` and `customQuestions` to produce the final form for that company.

## 4. Building Pages and Components

### 4.1. Create App Structure and Layouts

-   `src/app/layout.tsx`: Root layout that includes the `AuthProvider`, `Toaster`, and global font definitions.
-   `src/app/page.tsx`: The main landing page, which contains the multi-role `Login` component. It includes logic to redirect authenticated users to their respective dashboards.
-   `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`: Layout for the end-user dashboard, including the `DashboardNav` sidebar.
-   `src/app/admin/layout.tsx`: Layout for all administrative roles (Admin, HR), including the collapsible admin sidebar with role-based navigation links.

### 4.2. End-User Flow Pages

-   **Profile (`/dashboard/profile`):**
    -   Create a `ProfileForm` component that uses `react-hook-form` and a `zod` schema (`src/lib/schemas.ts`) for robust validation.
    -   Group questions into logical sections using `Card` components.
    -   Implement conditional rendering for fields like "self-describe gender."
-   **Assessment (`/dashboard/assessment`):**
    -   Create an `AssessmentForm` component.
    -   Dynamically build the form and its validation schema using the questions provided by `useUserData.getCompanyConfig()`. This ensures company-specific customizations are applied.
    -   Implement conditional logic to show/hide sub-questions based on the parent question's answer (e.g., show "relocation date" only if "relocation paid" is "Yes").
    -   The form should automatically populate with any data pre-filled by an HR manager (e.g., final employment date).
-   **Dashboard (`/dashboard`):**
    -   Create a `ProgressTracker` component to show before both the profile and assessment are complete. It should disable the "Exit Details" button until the profile is done.
    -   Create the `TimelineDashboard` component to display the AI-generated recommendations after both forms are complete. This component fetches data from the Genkit flow.

### 4.3. Admin & HR Flow Pages

-   **Form Editor (`/admin/forms`):**
    -   Build a dual-mode page that renders either the `AdminFormEditor` or `HrFormEditor` based on the user's role.
    -   **Admin View:** Allow creating, editing, and deleting questions from the master list. Implement drag-and-drop reordering using `@dnd-kit`.
    -   **HR View:** Allow HR Managers to enable/disable master questions and edit their text/options (creating overrides). Allow adding new company-specific custom questions.
    -   **Update Alerts:** In the HR view, display a visual indicator (`BellDot` icon) next to any question that has been updated by an Admin since the HR manager last saved their configuration.
-   **Company Management (`/admin/companies`):**
    -   Create a page with a `Table` to list all companies from `useUserData`.
    -   Include columns for key stats: Users Added, Max Users, Assessments Completed, and Custom Questions (count of modified/new questions).
    -   Implement a form to add new companies and assign HR Managers.
-   **User Management (`/admin/users`):**
    -   Build a page for Admins/HR to add or remove end-users for a specific company. Display the user's assessment completion status.
    -   **HR View:** Provide functionality to add users individually or via a CSV bulk upload. The bulk upload supports pre-filling optional assessment data (like severance deadlines and coverage end dates) and updating existing non-invited users.
-   **Export (`/admin/export`):**
    -   Implement a page that compiles a list of all users from all sources (`platformUsers`, `companyAssignments`, and end-users from all `companyConfigs`).
    -   Display key user statuses, such as invitation status, profile completion, and assessment completion. For the Admin view, show a simplified "Past" or "Future" indicator for notification dates.
    -   Provide an "Export to CSV" function that generates and triggers a download of the user list.

## 5. AI Integration with Genkit

### 5.1. Create Genkit Flow

In `src/ai/flows/personalized-recommendations.ts`, define a Genkit flow that generates a personalized action plan for the user.
-   **Input/Output Schemas:** Use `zod` to define strongly-typed input and output schemas.
    -   `PersonalizedRecommendationsInputSchema`: Defines the expected structure of the user's `profileData` and `layoffDetails`, including fields like `severanceAgreementDeadline`.
    -   `PersonalizedRecommendationsOutputSchema`: Defines the desired output, which is a list of `RecommendationItem` objects. This tells the LLM to structure its response as a JSON array.
-   **Prompt Engineering:**
    -   Write a detailed system prompt instructing the LLM to act as an expert career counselor.
    -   Use Handlebars templating (`{{{...}}}`) to dynamically insert the user's data into the prompt.
    -   Explicitly ask the model to provide a unique `taskId`, `task`, `category`, `timeline`, `details`, and an optional `endDate` for each recommendation, and to sort the list by urgency.
-   **Flow Function:** Export an async wrapper function (`getPersonalizedRecommendations`) that calls the Genkit flow.
    -   **Resiliency:** Implement a retry mechanism within the flow to handle temporary "503 Service Unavailable" errors from the AI model, making the feature more robust. This function will be used by the `TimelineDashboard` component to fetch the recommendations.

This guide provides a comprehensive roadmap to recreate the core functionality of the Exitbetter application. Each step involves creating components, defining logic, and styling according to the project's design guidelines.
